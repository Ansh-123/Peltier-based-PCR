# Peltier-based-PCR
A low cost peltier module based PCR machine.



My goal for this project is to create a relatively low cost PCR machine using peltier module. There are many other projects with similar goals of low cost PCR (pocketPCR,openPCR, ...), though the tend to use a resistive heating element with a fan for cooling.

The main hardware for this project is an esp32 (I used a esp32 cam as I had one on hand), a thermistor, peltier module, a 40mm fan, 100k resistor, 3d printed parts and wires+breadboard.

In the future I hope to design PCB and implement a heated lid.

If you would like to learn more about the design and how to make one yourself, take a look at the instructables (at the moment not yet ready).
